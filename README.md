Welcome to TimiCares, a simple and stylish web app built to showcase the best black hair care products. This app helps users explore and favorite their top picks for hair products, all in one place. Created using React and Vite.js, TimiCares is fast, responsive, and easy to use. Plus, it looks good on both phones and desktops thanks to Tailwind CSS.
Features

    Favoriting Products: You can click on products to save them to your favorites list, and keep track of what you love.
    Responsive Design: Whether you’re on a phone, tablet, or laptop, the app adjusts itself perfectly for your screen size.
    Logo Added: TimiCares has its own unique logo, making it stand out visually.

Challenges I Faced

    React State Management: Figuring out how to handle product favorites across multiple components was tricky at first. I used React’s useState to make this work smoothly.
    Responsive Design: Making sure the app looks great on all screen sizes required some fine-tuning, but with Tailwind CSS, it became much easier to adjust layouts.
    Logo Integration: Adding the TimiCares logo to the header was a fun challenge. It needed to be responsive and blend well with the rest of the design.

Future Plans

    Add a Cart: In the future, I would like to add a shopping cart so users can add products and buy them.
    User Login: Adding user login to save favorites across different sessions would be awesome.
    Improved Search: I plan to add a more powerful search bar for users to quickly find what they need.
